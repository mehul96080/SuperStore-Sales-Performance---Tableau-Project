# SuperStore-Sales-Performance---Tableau-Project
For the Capstone Project on Superstore Sales Performance, I developed an interactive Tableau Dashboard that presents a comprehensive view of sales data. The dashboard includes visualizations such as total sales, profit, and volume, complemented by a pie chart showing sales distribution by region and a bar chart highlighting top states by sales. Additional elements include a bubble chart depicting sales by sub-category and a line chart illustrating sales trends over time. Filters for order date, segment, ship mode, and state allow users to customize their view, with actionable elements and a fixed-size layout for clarity. The workbook, published on Tableau Public, meets all requirements and features a cohesive design with hidden worksheets and formatted filters for an enhanced user experience.
